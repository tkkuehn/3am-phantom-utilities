Welcome to the dMRI Phantom Utilities user documentation!
=========================================================

dMRI phantom utilities provide a convenient framework for analyzing diffusion-weighted MR images of 3D printed axon-mimetic (3AM) phantoms. Using this package, you can automatically mask the phantoms in an image, perform a DTI or DKI fit of phantom data, and generate a ground truth image of fibre orientation or crossing angle registered to the source DWI.
